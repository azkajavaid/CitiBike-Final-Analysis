###Section 1: Introduction

For this project, we investigated the CitiBike dataset, supplementing our analysis with weather data. CitiBike is a public bike-share 
program in New York City which allows users to pay a daily or weekly fee (these users are called “customers”) or a yearly subscription 
fee (“subscribers) to gain access to bikes that are docked at stations throughout the city. CitiBikes are commonly used by tourists and 
commuters going to work. The CitiBike dataset was obtained from the official CitiBike website, and consists of information on all CitiBike
rides in February, July and October for 2014. The weather dataset was obtained from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) Climate Data 
Online Search (CDO) for February, July and October 2014. Our research question can be summarized as: what are the interesting, unique, or 
relevant features of the CitiBike user base, and what do we know about users’ behaviors? More specifically, we investigate how weather and
season affect the volume of users, how to predict whether users will return their bikes late, whether the customers behave differently 
than subscribers, and whether female and male users behave differently.

  This question is relevant for a number of reasons. Although privately run and sponsored, CitiBike is a public service affiliated with 
  the New York City government. Thus, New York City voters probably want to know whether this service is really benefitting them. Also, 
  since CitiBike is a public service, some voters or politicians might find it concerning if certain demographics were benefitting more 
  than others. If men disproportionately use CitiBikes compared with women, this might be seen as a moral or political issue; even if not,
  it would suggest that there is a largely untapped market for female CitiBike users that current advertising and marketing strategies 
  have neglected. Information on predicting lateness is highly relevant because chronic lateness potentially threatens the functioning of 
  the bikeshare system: if everyone returns their bikes late, then fewer bikes will be available when they are supposed to be. Being able 
  to predict user volume for a given day would also be incredibly helpful to the CitiBike management, as they could plan ahead for days 
  where volume will be high by having more support staff ready and strategically schedule bike maintenance and system tests for days when 
  volume is likely to be low.


###Section 2: Data

Dataset1: Each row in the CitiBike dataset (each observational unit) represents one CitiBike trip, information on the trip and the user 
who tok the trip. The CitiBike dataset contained variables like Trip Duration (seconds), Start Time and Date & Stop Time and Date, Start 
Station Name & End Station Name, Usertype (Customer = 24-hour pass or 7-day pass user, vs Subscriber = Annual Member), Gender (0=unknown, 
1=male, 2=female). 

Dataset2: Each row represented weather condition of a single day in NYC JFK Airport, used to represent weather in New York City. The 
dataset contained predictors like AWND (average wind speed in tenths of meters per second), TMAX (maximum temperature in tenths of degrees 
Celsius), TMIN (minimum temperature in tenths of degrees Celsius), PRCP (precipitation in tenths of mm) and SNOW (Snowfall in mm). For 
convenience, SNOW and PRCP were changed to categorical predictors signaling snow and rain (Yes) or no snow and no rain (No). In order to 
properly account for the changes in the average wind speed, the AWND predictor was transformed to a categorical predictor (CatAWND) with 
three levels based on the appropriate Beaufort Scale (Light-Gentle breeze, Moderate breeze and Fresh breeze). The TMAX variable was also 
transformed as DFTMAX, which accounted for the difference between the actual max temperature that day and the average max temperature of 
the month in degrees Fahrenheit. 

A new dataset is produced by merging the weather and the CitiBike dataset to depict the aggregate bike use and weather condition of a day.
Each row is a day with weather predictors PRCPY (Yes/No), SNWD (Yes/No), CatAWND (categorical), Month (February, July or October) and 
DFTMAX (quantitative in degrees Fahrenheit). The aggregate bike use is depicted by predictors including the startday(date), number of 
rides of each gender and each user type, mean trip duration and  total numRides and SD (standard deviation) of trip duration.   

Note: In the CitiBike dataset, the observations attributed to staff servicing the bikes, trips to or from special “test stations,” 
were removed. Also, around 189 subscribers reported to be born in 1899 or the early 1900s, which seemed unlikely. Categorization of 
the date of birth variable into age allowed for the exclusion of such values. The gender and birth year data was not included for 
customers in the CitiBike dataset. In the weather dataset, missing values were portrayed by -9999. 

We first characterized the CitiBike users over the three months. For this analysis, we calculated the total number of males and females 
users in February, July and October. We used a barplot to illustrate the difference in the number of rides by gender, leading us to 
observe that CitiBike users in February, July and October were predominantly male. The volume of users was highest in July for both 
genders, and there was a greater increase in the number of male users than female users from February to July. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, collapse=TRUE,fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
M<-c(176526, 569685, 521345)
Fe<-c(41479, 179322, 154121)
mnew=data.frame(Males=M, Females = Fe)
rownames(mnew) <- c("Feb", "July", "Oct")
mnew <- as.matrix(mnew)
barplot(mnew, main="Number of Riders by Gender and Month", xlab="Month", col=c("darkblue","red","orange"), beside=TRUE)
legend("topleft", c("July","Feb","Oct"),
fill=c("red","blue","orange"))
```

Considering that the CitiBike usage appeared to be highest in July, it was interesting to analyze whether this increase could be 
accounted for by the  greater number of tourists we expect to see in NYC in July (when the weather is nicer and students are on break). 
There is no direct way to identify a CitiBike user as a tourist, but it seems likely that most tourists would not have annual memberships. 
Thus, the next step was to characterize usertype (Subscribers or Customers). We observed that there are more CitiBike subscribers than 
customers, even in July. Overall, 97.68% of users were subscribers. We noted that the increase in number of subscribers from February to 
July was greater than the increase in customers in that time period. July was the highest-volume month for both user types, perhaps 
because people generally have more time for exploring NYC in the summer than in fall and winter.

                       CatAWND=cut(MAWND,

```

#####Characterizing effect of weather on CitiBike users (Additive and Interaction Models):

```{r, echo=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
m1=lm(numRides~Month+CatAWND+DFTMAX+PRCPY, data=plotmyFinal2)
m2=lm(numRides~CatAWND+DFTMAX*Month+PRCPY, data=plotmyFinal2)
```

In order to analyze the effect of weather on CitiBike usage, we built a model with numRides (number of riders) as the response 
variable against DFTMAX, Month, PRCPY and CatAWND additive predictors. From anova, all predictors were significant (p-value<0.05). 
The positive coefficient of 457.76 on DFTMAX indicates that a one-degree increase in difference between daily maximum temperature and 
average maximum temperature for that month leads to an increase in the number of CitiBike users by about 458. This indicates that 
CitiBike users prefer higher-than-average max temperature days relative to the average temperature of the current month. The coefficient 
of 22441.46 on MonthJuly indicates that there is an increase in the  CitiBike users by about 22441 in July relative to February. The 
coefficient of 18236.82 for MonthOctober indicates that there are about 18237 more CitiBike users in October than in February. For 
PRCPYYes, the coefficient of -4560.66 indicates that volume of CitiBike users decreases by about 4561 in rain. For CatAWNDModerate breeze,
the coefficient of -1528.85 indicates that given moderate breeze, volume of users decreases by about 1529 users. In comparison, the volume
of users decreases by about 4479 (given coefficient of -4478.78) on a fresh breeze day. Generally, CitiBike users prefer no precipitation,
higher-than-usual temperatures, and low wind speed (Moderate rather than Fresh) as ideal biking conditions. 

  Given that an interaction effect was observed between DFTMAX and Month predictors, we then added an interaction of DFTMAX and Month to 
  our model. We observed that all coefficients, including the interaction term, were significant (p-value<0.05) from anova. The first 
  interaction term (DFTMAX:MonthJuly) with the coefficient of 899.4 indicates that the increase in users associated with a one degree 
  increase in temperature is about 899 individuals greater in July than in February. The increase in users associated with a one degree 
  increase in temperature is 664 individuals greater in October than in February (as indicated by the 664.3 cofficient). It thus appears 
  a day with a max temperature higher than the average max temperature of the month is associated with the largest increase in user 
  volume in July and the smallest increase in volume in February.
  
The graph below illustrates the effect of precipitation (no/yes) on the relationship between temperature and number of rides for 
all three months.

coefVals1:Bootstrap MonthJuly confidence interval (CI) (20139.37,24743.56)

coefVals2: Bootstrap MonthOctober CI (12675.37,23798.27).

coefVals3: Bootstrap CatAWNDModerate Breeze CI (-23760.63,-19013.96).

coefVals5: Bootstrap DFTMAX CI (-19787.4,-15040.74).

coefVals6: Bootstrap DFTMAX:MonthJuly CI (152.0305,1646.706).

Given that 0 is not included in the confidence interval for MonthJuly coefficient, the MonthJuly predictor is significant in predicting 
the number of rides. Similar analysis was extended to other predictors and it was observed that all the predictors are signficant at an 
alpha level of 0.05, because their 95% confidence intervals exclude 0. Note: We could not calculate bootstrap for PRCPY and 
DFTMAX:MonthOctober since both methods 1 and 2 produce NA for confidence intervals and the file does not knit if the third method for 
calculating confidence intervals is used. 

#####Effect of weather on Customers (Additive model):

```{r, echo=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
m3=lm(Customer~DFTMAX+Month+PRCPY+CatAWND, data=plotmyFinal2)
```

Given that males, females and subscribers all had trends that were similar to the overall number of riders (as described by the previous
model), we decided to just focus on CitiBike Customers for this analysis. We built a model with the same predictors as the total number 
of riders. Surprisingly the DFTMAX and the CatAWND predictors were not significant at an alpha level of 0.05, as revealed by anova. 
Generally, CitiBike customers prefer no precipitation, higher temperature than the average max temperature of the month and lower average
wind speed (Moderate rather than Fresh) as ideal biking conditions. Considering that the DFTMAX predictor was not significant, we did not
interact DFTMAX with the Month predictor.

Graphing Customer rides against DFTMAX, with and without precipitation:

```{r, echo=FALSE, collapse=TRUE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3}
ggplot(data=plotmyFinal2, aes(x=DFTMAX, y=Customer)) + geom_point()  + aes(colour=Month) + facet_wrap(~PRCPY, ncol=4)  + 
stat_smooth(method=lm) + labs(title="Number of Customers vs. Precipitation and Temperature") 
```

labs(title="Number of Customers vs. Average Wind") 
```

#####Analyzing Extreme Trip Durations 

The  trip duration for all users shows a wide range, from as short as 60 seconds to 766108 seconds. The mean percentage of subscribers 
who go over time is 1.27% which is significantly lower than 19.03%, which is the mean percentage for customers. The ratio for all users
who go over time is 1.75%, reflecting the fact that most of the users are subscribers. The histograms compare distribution of trip 
durations between subscribers and customers, comparing the ratios of subscribers and customers who go over time. Note: Customers go 
over time at 1800 seconds (30 min); subscribers go overtime at 2700 seconds (45 min).

#ladd(panel.abline(v=105*60,col="purple",lty=5,add=TRUE))
```

The dataset RatioData is transformed to have 28 rows, where each row represent a single day with daytype (weekend/weekday), weather 
variables and the ratio of users who go over time. We developed two linear regression models to navigate the factors that might 
influence the ratio of subscribers and customers separately. Predictors included precipitation(PRCP),  Snow depth(SNWD), deviation of 
temperature from average temperature of the month(DFTMAX), average wind speed(AWND), and whether the day is a weekend or not(DayType).

For subscribers, predictors PRCP,SNWD,AWND,Daytype are all significant predictors at a=0.01. Snow depth, precipitation and average wind
speed are positively correlated with overtime ratio, which means the worse the weather conditions are, the higher the percentage of 
subscribers who go over time.

The model produced is $\hat{SubRatio}$=PRCP*0.003823 + SNWD*0.003693 + AWND*0.0189 + Daytype*0.1438. With a unit(tenth of mm) increase 
in preciptation, the ratio of subscriber who go over time will increase by 0.38%. R-squared is 0.6619, meaning this is a pretty useful 
model. Given a unit increase (mm) in snow depth, the ratio of subscriber who go over time will increase by 0.37%. For an unit increase 
(tenths of m/s) in average wind speed, the ratio of subscribers go over time increase 1.89%. The percentage of subscribers who go over 
time will increase 14%  if the day is weekend. To our surprise, DFTMAX, which illustrates deviation of max temperature from average 
monthly temperature, doesn’t have any predictive power in terms of predicting whether a ride will be over time.

m1=lm(SubRatio~PRCP+SNWD+DFTMAX+AWND+Daytype,data=RatioData)
```

For customers, the predictors which were significant for subscribers have very low predictive power. None of the predictors are 
significant at significance level  a=0.05.

A logistic model is developed to predict the chance that a given subscriber returns the bike late. Predictors that passed the linearity 
check are entered into the model and all are significant at the significant level 
a=0.001.logit($\hat{OverTime}$) =0.0098*age + 0.3211*gender + 0.0011*DFTMAX + 0.0014*PRCP + 0.0036*SNWD + 0.0079*AWND + 0.48*Weekend.
The weather predictors are positively correlated with the chance that a given subscriber returns the bike late. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
m3=glm(OverTime~age+gender+DFTMAX+PRCP+SNWD+AWND+Weekend,data=OverSub,family=binomial)
```


##### What are the chances that a given subscriber is female?
In the following two models, we predict whether an individual rider is female or male using gender (a binary predictor) and two 
quantitative weather predictors, PRCP (precipitation in .1 mm) and AWND (average daily wind speed in .1 meters/second).


##### Summary of logistic regression model Gender ~ Weekend {.smaller}

```{r,echo=FALSE, collapse=TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=2}
SubBike1 <- transform(SubBike1, 
                        Weekend=ifelse(as.numeric(startDoW)<6,0,1))
SubBike1Known <- filter(SubBike1, gender > 0)
SubBike1Known <- transform(SubBike1Known, gender = ifelse(gender==1,0,1))
gender1 <- glm(gender~Weekend,data=SubBike1Known,family=binomial)
plotFun(makeFun(gender1))
x6 <- xyplot(gender~jitter(Weekend),data=SubBike1Known,type=c("p","r"))
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,collapse=TRUE,fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
summary(gender1)
anova(gender1,test="Chisq")
plot(resid(gender1, type="pearson"))
```

Conditions: We can assume linearity because the one predictor in the model is a binary variable. We expect the gender of any one rider 
to be independent of the gender of other riders, so the independence condition is met. We expect gender to roughly follow a binomial 
model conditional on a fixed value for weekend, so the randomness assumption seems reasonable.

The model that is produced is: logit($\hat{Gender}$)=-1.597612 + 0.455288I(Weekend). The intercept of -1.597612 means that the predicted 
odds of a rider being female on a weekday are 0.2023792 (equivalent to a probability of 0.1683156). The coefficient of 0.455288 means 
that the predicted odds of a rider being female on a weekend are 0.3190766 (equivalent to a probability of 0.2418939). We find a Wald's 
statistic of 39.6 for the coefficient of Weekend, corresponding to a p-value of less than 2e-16, which is less than the alpha-level of 0. 
The likelihood ratio test results in a p-value of less than 2.2e-16 for the coefficient of Weekend, also less than alpha=.05. Thus, 
Weekend is a significant predictor of logit($\hat{Gender}$) in this model. A plot of Pearson's residuals shows no potentially problematic
outliers.

```
```{r,echo=FALSE, collapse=TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}

```

Conditions: We must check the conditions for each predictor. The empirical logit plots for precipitation (PRCP) and average wind 
speed (AWND) both look roughly linear, so the linearity assumption seems reasonable. We expect the gender of any one rider to be
independent of the gender of other riders, so the independence condition is met. We expect gender to roughly follow a binomial model
conditional on a fixed value for weekend, so the randomness assumption seems reasonable.

The model that is produced is: logit($\hat{Gender}$)=-1.0892486 + -0.0014792PRCP + -0.0071283AWND. The intercept -1.0892486 means that, 
with no precipitation or wind, the predicted odds of a rider being female are 0.3364692. The coefficient of PRCP -0.0014792 means that 
the predicted odds of a rider being female decrease by 0.0014781 for every .1 mm increase in precipitation. The coefficient of 
AWND -0.0071283 means that the predicted odds of a rider being female decrease by 0.007103 for every .1 meter/second increase in 
average wind speed. We find Wald's statistics of -11.93 for PRCP and -21.55 for AWND, both corresponding to a p-value less than the 
alpha-level of .05. The likelihood ratio test for the two predictors results in p-values less than 2.2e-16 for both, smaler than the 
alpha level. Thus, PRCP and AWND are significant predictors of logit($\hat{Gender}$) in this model. A plot of Pearson's residuals shows 
a potentially problematic outlier with a Pearson's residual larger than 3. When we re-fit the model without the outlier, we get the model
logit($\hat{Gender}$)=-1.0685018 + -0.0018987PRCP + -0.0075089AWND. The coefficients for the model with and without the outlier are 
extremely similar, so the outlier does not seem to pose a problem.

###Section 4: Conclusions
From our analysis, we’ve developed a strong understanding of the behavior and demographics of CitiBike users. First, we found that 
CitiBike users are predominantly male and predominantly subscribers across all three months. Next, we constructed models to predict the 
effect of weather on user volume, finding that users generally prefer no precipitation, moderate wind speed, and warmer-than-usual 
weather, and that their preference for warm weather is strongest in July and weakest in February. (For customers, we were surprised to
find that wind speed and temperature were not significant predictors of volume.) Next, we looked at trip duration, finding that 
customers were more prone to going over their 30 minute limit than subscribers were to going over their 45 minute limit. We found that 
snow depth, high wind, precipitation, and the day being a weekend all corresponded to subscribers going over time. Finally, we modeled 
the gender of the riders, finding that, while the vast majority of trips were taken by men, the gender balance for trips taken on 
weekends and days with less precipitation and wind was somewhat more even. 

We do have some concerns about the data. One problem is that bikes are sometimes accidentally undocked and redocked during the docking 
process, leading to large numbers of short “rides” being recorded which are not actual rides. Our analysis could have benefitted from 
more information being gathered from users, such as address and race, which would give us a better picture of what kinds of demographics
the CitiBike program appeals to. If we could control the data collection, we would ask those questions. We would also want to ask the
same set of questions to all users; we found it very limiting to look at gender when we only had gender data for subscribers. 
Furthermore, the data we have does not identify specific users, so we do not know whether any two rides were taken by the same user. 
It would be interesting to see information like this, for example, to see whether there are customers who are frequently using CitiBike,
which would raise the question of why they chose not to subscribe annually. Finally, it would be interesting to compare our datasets 
with New York City traffic data from the same periods, to see whether car traffic discourages or encourages CitiBike usage, and to see 
if the predictors for CitiBike usage also predict traffic.
