This project explored how volume of CitiBike use in New York City in February, July and October in 2014 differs by weather patterns. 
We were also interested in assessing how CitiBike use differs for weekend/weekday status, for males/females users as well as for
CitiBike subscribers/customers. We obtained datasets from the CitiBike website and weather data from the National Climatic Data Center 
(NCDC) Climate Data Online Search (CDO). Our analysis was performed in R and included techniques like data cleaning, aggregating,
merging (dplyr, tidyr) and visualizing (ggplot) as well as linear, logistic and ANOVA regression along with bootstrapping and others. 
Our conclusions were that CitiBike users usually prefer no precipitation, moderate wind speed, and warmer than usual weather. We also 
found that customers are more likely to go over their 30 minute trip duration limit than subscribers are to go over their 45 minute limit.
Snow depth, high wind, precipitation and the day being a weekend all correspond to subscribers going overtime. In regards to gender, 
we found that although there are higher number of male CitiBike riders than females, gender ratio of bike usage is more balanced on 
weekends and on days with less precipitation (See attached WrittenReport for further description of methodology/results and the FinalHandout for a quick summary of the conclusions).
